# Restaurant Data Analysis and Classification

## Overview
This project involves comprehensive analysis and classification of restaurants using a dataset containing various attributes of restaurants, such as location, cuisine, ratings, and more. The project includes multiple tasks, completed as part of an internship at **Cognifyz Technologies** as a** Machine Learning intern**.

## Tasks

### 1. Restaurant Rating Prediction
**Objective:** Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.

### 2. Restaurant Recommendation System
**Objective:** Create a recommendation system based on user preferences.

### 3. Cuisine Classification
**Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines.

### 4. Location-based Analysis
**Objective:** Perform a geographical analysis of the restaurants in the dataset to gain insights into their distribution and characteristics.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for each task.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
- **results/**: Contains the results of the analysis, including visualizations and model performance metrics.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `folium`

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-analysis-classification.git
    cd restaurant-analysis-classification
    ```



2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the analysis and model training process:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook notebooks/
    ```

## Results
- **Restaurant Rating Prediction:** Achieved an accuracy of 97% using Decision Tree Regression.
- **Restaurant Recommendation System:** Successfully implemented a content-based filtering approach.
- **Cuisine Classification:** Achieved an accuracy of X% using Random Forest Classifier.
- **Location-based Analysis:** Generated various visualizations to show the distribution and characteristics of restaurants.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the restaurant data and demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques for prediction, recommendation, classification, and geographical analysis.
